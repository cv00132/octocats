# Styling HTML Using only CSS

* Assignment - * Understand HTML/CSS Layout
               * Be able to place any element on a page where you want it.
               * Use CSS Floats
               * Use CSS Positioning
               * Use Git & Github

1. CSS
  * Used [Raw HTML octocats images, unordered]{https://tiy-learn-content.s3.amazonaws.com/16fcac8f-index.html} as reference for style work
  * Utilized `margin`, `width`, `height`, `padding`, and `borders` to alter size of images.
  * With `float` I aligned images.
  * Employed `pseudo elements` I was able to add a `#` to the image number
  * Added an upside-down arrow using `position: absolute` and anchored it to the image-caption using `position: relative`.

2. GitHub
  * Continued my use of GitHub as version control by committing changes on a regular basis.
